# Olympic-Data-Engineering-Project
Getting started with Data engineering 

Tools/Tech: Azure Data Factory, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, PySpark

Designed and implemented an end-to-end data pipeline on Azure Cloud for processing and analyzing Olympics data.

Ingested raw CSV data from a public GitHub repository using Azure Data Factory (ADF) and stored it securely in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS).

Integrated Azure Databricks with ADLS to read raw data and performed data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment using PySpark.

Stored the transformed data back into ADLS in a structured format for further processing.

Loaded the cleaned and transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics for downstream analytics and reporting.

Performed data analysis and generated insights such as country-wise medal counts, top-performing athletes, and sport-wise performance trends.

Ensured modular, scalable pipeline design supporting future enhancements and large dataset handling.
